- [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com) - this is excellent website that help me check if some css like text-rendering support all browsers

- [flexbox game](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - this game help me exercise basic flexbox layout. This was more fun than reading documentation.

- [grid game](https://cssgridgarden.com/) - another fun game that help exercise basic grid layout.

- [css boxshadow](https://cssgenerator.pl/box-shadow-generator/) - i know that i can do it by setting this by myself but this generator show me precisely which value i can set without without unnecessary testing.
